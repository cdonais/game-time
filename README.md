## Description
Game Time is a web application that facilitates finding and creating pickup basketball games at local courts. 

Once the user creates an account or logs in, they will be taken to the "dashboard" page where they will see a list of the games they've created, and a list of their upcoming games that they have joined. Each game includes the time, date, location, and skill level required for the players. 

From the "find a game" tab, the user can look through and join games created by other users. 

If the user chooses to create their own game, they must go to the "create game" tab where they will be prompted to enter the location, date, and time of the game, and they must also include the skill level of players that they are looking for.
